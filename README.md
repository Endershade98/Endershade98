# **Hi, I'm Nunzio**

Junior Web Developer with a background in **Python** and **Machine Learning**, I finished recently an intensive training program focused on Python and Machine Learning with hands-on experience in ML and data-driven **projects**. You can find more about this intensive course on the following link: [Python & Machine Learning Course Repo](https://github.com/Endershade98/Nunzio_De_Cicco_Python_Course_Repo.git).

## **Technological Stack**

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Django, FastAPI, Node.js (basics)
- **Database**: MySQL, SQLite, Redis
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Docker (basics), Linux (basics), Git, VSCode
- **Currently Learning**: OAuth, Dependency Inversion, Dependency Injection, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Arduino and RaspberryPI

## **Projects**

Here are a few projects I've worked on during my training:
- [Donat Shop Manager](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Donut-Shop-Manager---Gestionale-Python.git) (team project): Donut Shop Manager is a management system written in Python that simulates a login and user registration system, inventory management, and sales operations for a donut shop. This project is a great practical example of object-oriented programming (OOP), as well as the use of decorators, regex, logging, and data structures.

- [MySQL Database Manager](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Gestionale_Database.git) (team project): A simple command-line tool to connect to a MySQL server, manage databases, tables, and data â€” written in Python. Designed with a modular architecture that includes abstraction, concrete classes, and clean error handling.

- [Spotify Data Analysis](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Progetto_Analisi_Spotify) (team project): This project is an in-depth analysis of Spotify music data, exploring the daily charts from 2018 up to October 2020. Using Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the goal is to uncover musical trends, analyze the performance of songs and artists, and visualize changes over time.

- [BeFirstKC](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/BeFirstKC---GUI-for-Kaggle-Dataset.git) (team project): This project was born as a learning exercise for a junior Python developer with a growing interest in Data Analysis and Machine Learning. The goal is to combine data analysis with an interactive graphical interface built with PyQt5, exploring fundamental concepts such as: data manipulation with Python, presentation of interactive visual elements, management of animations and visual feedback for the user.

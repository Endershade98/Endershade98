## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on during my training:
- [Donat Shop](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Donut-Shop-Manager---Gestionale-Python.git) (team project): Donut Shop Manager is a management system written in Python that simulates a login and user registration system, inventory management, and sales operations for a donut shop. This project is a great practical example of object-oriented programming (OOP), as well as the use of decorators, regex, logging, and data structures.

- [MySQL Database Manager](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Gestionale_Database.git) (team project): A simple command-line tool to connect to a MySQL server, manage databases, tables, and data â€” written in Python. Designed with a modular architecture that includes abstraction, concrete classes, and clean error handling.
Features:
  - Connect to a MySQL server
  - Create and select databases
  - Create custom tables
  - Add and remove columns
  - Delete tables
  - Insert and update data

- [Spotify Data Analysis](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Progetto_Analisi_Spotify) (team project): This project is an in-depth analysis of Spotify music data, exploring the daily charts from 2018 up to October 2020. Using Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the goal is to uncover musical trends, analyze the performance of songs and artists, and visualize changes over time.
Features:
  - Statistical Analysis of Daily Rankings
  - Exploration of the performance of the most listened-to songs over time
  - Interactive visualization to analyze music trends
  - Study of the most popular music genres during the period

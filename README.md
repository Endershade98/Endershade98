# Hi, I'm Nunzio

Junior Web Developer with a background in **Python** and **Machine Learning**, I'm currently finishing an intensive training program focused on Python and Machine Learning with hands-on experience in ML and data-driven **projects**.

## Technological Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS (basics)

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on during my training:
- [Donat Shop Manager](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Donut-Shop-Manager---Gestionale-Python.git) — Donut Shop Manager is a management system written in Python that simulates a login and user registration system, inventory management, and sales operations for a donut shop. This project is a great practical example of object-oriented programming (OOP), as well as the use of decorators, regex, logging, and data structures.

- [MySQL Database Manager](https://github.com/GiovanniP9/Gestionale_Database.git) — A simple command-line tool to connect to a MySQL server, manage databases, tables, and data, written in Python. Designed with a modular architecture that includes abstraction, concrete classes, and clean error handling.
